# Heart-Disease-CLassification
This is a Machine Learning Project.
I have predicted using the given sent of data if a patient has heart disease or not.
The original data came from Cleveland data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
There is a version available on Kaggle too.
Tools like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, Scikit Learn modules etc have been used.
